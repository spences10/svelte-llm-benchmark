# Inspect Benchmark Prompt

In Svelte 5 runes mode, the `$inspect.trace()` function has specific
usage rules:

- It cannot be used inside a generator function.
- It must be the first statement of a function body.

Write a Svelte component that demonstrates the correct usage of
`$inspect.trace()` within a function to trace reactive updates.

Provide the Svelte code within a single markdown code block.
