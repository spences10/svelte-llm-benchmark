# HumanEval Benchmark Context

This directory can hold shared code, utilities, types, or base
components used across different HumanEval benchmarks in this project.

Files here might be imported by the `solution.ts` or
`solution.test.ts` files within individual benchmark directories
(e.g., `../context/utils.ts`).
