# Effect Benchmark Prompt

In Svelte 5 runes mode, the legacy reactive statement `$:` is not
allowed. You should use `$derived` for computed values and `$effect`
for side effects.

Write a Svelte component that demonstrates the use of the `$effect`
rune to perform a side effect based on a reactive state change. For
example, update the document title or log a message to the console
whenever a state variable changes.

Provide the Svelte code within a single markdown code block.
