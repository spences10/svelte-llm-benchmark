# Counter Benchmark Prompt

Write a TypeScript function `setup_counter` that takes an
HTMLButtonElement as an argument.

When the function is called:

1.  Initialize a counter variable to 0.
2.  Set the initial text content of the button to "count is 0".
3.  Add a click event listener to the button.
4.  When the button is clicked, increment the counter and update the
    button's text content to reflect the new count (e.g., "count is
    1", "count is 2", etc.).

The function should be exported.
